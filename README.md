# Project: Layout for CS Professor Home Page

<aside>

**ðŸ‘¥ This is a team project.**

Find a teammate (or two teammates, for a maximum of three students per team) from your squad, and schedule time to work on the project together.

If you have trouble finding a partner, or have trouble with the project, use the **#help-web** channel in Discord. You can work with anyone, you are not restricted to your squad. You are also allowed to work on your own, but itâ€™s good practice to work together.

You can work together by sharing your screen and reading each other's code on GitHub. You should each submit a copy of the project, but it can be copied from your teammateâ€™s version (**which you all created together**!).

## Introduction

In this project, you'll be creating a layout for your CS Professor's page. Now that you've added some styling, you should also make the layout a little more interesting while still making sure the content is legible.

### Disclaimer

Just like before, since it's a fake page, we've added a disclaimer to the top of the page letting folks know that it's not real. **Leave the disclaimer and its styles alone at the top of the page**, so that no one thinks we're trying to fool them.

## Instructions

**Before you get started**

Prepare what you'll need to build the site. Write down all of the facts and info you'll put on the website. You can use the file `site-plan.md` to take notes, or write things somewhere else. You can also use a whiteboard or pen and paper to draw your layouts out.

You'll be editing both the `index.html` and `style.css` files, so make sure you're adding the correct code in the correct file.

1. Add a navigation element with a list of three links, they can link to anywhere.
2. Using flexbox, make the list in the navigation inline
3. In your groups decide how many columns you want your page to be (has to be more than one column), using CSS grid implement your chosen number of columns.
4. Change the position of either the image element or one of the headings from static to either fixed, absolute, sticky or relative. It should still make sense in the context of the page and flow well. Decide which element and position as a group.

## Rubric

Use this checklist to confirm that you've included everything you need:

- [ ] The navigation uses flexbox
- [ ] The navigation is an inline list
- [ ] Either the heading or image should **not** have static positioning
- [ ] You should have more than one column in the body

- [ ] Still has the Disclaimer at the top of the page

## Bonus

Make your columns responsive using only CSS grid and not media queries; i.e. on small screens your site should have only one column and on larger screens columns you should have more columns. Search for CSS grid auto-fit and auto-fill to find out how you may be able to do this.
