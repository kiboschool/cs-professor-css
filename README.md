# Project: JavaScript for CS Professor Home Page

<aside>

**ðŸ‘¥ This is a team project.**

Find a teammate (or two teammates, for a maximum of three students per team) from your squad, and schedule time to work on the project together.

If you have trouble finding a partner, or have trouble with the project, use the **#help-web** channel in Discord. You can work with anyone, you are not restricted to your squad. You are also allowed to work on your own, but itâ€™s good practice to work together.

You can work together by sharing your screen and reading each other's code on GitHub. You should each submit a copy of the project, but it can be copied from your teammateâ€™s version (**which you all created together**!).

## Introduction

In this project, you'll be adding JavaScript to your CS Professor page to make it interactive.

### Disclaimer

Just like before, since it's a fake page, we've added a disclaimer to the top of the page letting folks know that it's not real. **Leave the disclaimer and its styles alone at the top of the page**, so that no one thinks we're trying to fool them.

## Instructions

**Before you get started**

Prepare what you'll need to build the site. Write down all of the facts and info you'll put on the website. You can use the file `site-plan.md` to take notes, or write things somewhere else.

You'll be editing both the `index.html` and `main.js` files, so make sure you're adding the correct code in the correct file.
